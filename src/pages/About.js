            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>My name is Kara. I am a self-taught full-stack developer currently pursuing a bachelor's in Computer Science. I started learning to program at age 13, and have since learned to program in C/C++, C#, Java, JavaScript, Swift, Python, CSS, and HTML. I am knowledgable in React and have used it to make this very portfolio. I have taken high school classes to learn CSS, HTML and Swift, and a college class to learn Java and am self taught in everything else. I am most proficient in C#, however I have strengths in each language.</p>
            <p>I'm still working on my <a href="/resume">cool interactive resume</a> üòÅ!</p>
