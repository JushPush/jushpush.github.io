# Kara's Personal Portfolio

New Updates! I have made a few changes to my portfolio website

## Cleaned Up Navbar

I cleared up the cluttered buttons and added an account dropbar. This is mostly for my sake.

## Cleaned Up Blog Page

The blog cards now have interation animations so they don't feel so static. I also added an add post button on the blog page for my sake, which is invisible for everyone else.

### Oh, and Markdown support

I added markdown support, which will help me make blog posts look a lot nicer to the reader

## Changed Login Button on Login Page

Now it's a nice login with Google button, as of now this is useless.

## Plans for the Future

On the todo list so far I have
- [] Sort blog posts in chronological order
- [] Add support for images in blog posts, including post thumbnails
- [] Make blog post pages a little more pretty (very vague task)
- [] Add comments to blog posts
- [] Work on the resume
- [] Populate each page with important information about me

I'll edit this todo list whenever I remember to.

With this website I intend to reflect my abilities in React, as well as show off my personal accomplishments and resume. So far I'm feeling good about it.
